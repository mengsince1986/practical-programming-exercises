# 2. Unary minus negates a number. Unary plus exists as well; for example, Python understands +5. If x has the value -17, what do you think +x should do? Should it leave the sign of the number alone? Should it act like absolute value, removing any negation? Use the Python shell to find out its behavior.

x = -17

print('>>> x = -17')

print('>>> +x')

print(+x)

# x is still -17
