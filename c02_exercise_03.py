# 3. Write two assignment statements that do the following:

# a. Create a new variable, temp, and assign it the value 24.

# b. Convert the value in temp from Celsius to Fahrenheit by multiplying by 1.8 and adding 32; make temp refer to the resulting value. What is temp’s new value?

temp = 24

print('>>> temp = 24')

print('>>> temp')

print(temp)

temp = 1.8 * temp + 32

print('>>> temp = 1.8 * temp + 32')

print('>>> temp')

print(temp)
